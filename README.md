# ContactTracing

Randomized Rounding applied to Contact Tracing

## Setup

1. Ensure that Conda, Git, and Git-LFS are properly set up.
2. Use `conda env create -f environment.yml` to create a new environment called `tracing` which has all of the dependencies installed.
3. `conda activate tracing` to activate the conda environment
4. `pip install -e .` (This installs `ctrace` as a python package)
